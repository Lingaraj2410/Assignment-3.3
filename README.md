# Problem Statement:

We have a dataset of sales of different TV sets across different locations. 

Records look like: 
Samsung|Optima|14|Madhya Pradesh|132401|14200

The fields are arranged like: 
Company Name|Product Name|Size in inches|State|Pin Code|Price

There are some invalid records which contain 'NA' in either Company Name or Product Name. 

1. Write a Map Reduce program to calculate the total units sold for each Company.
2. Write a Map Reduce program to calculate the total units sold in each state for Onida
company.

# Solution Code Path for Task 1:
Assignment-3.3/Task 1/UnitsByCompany/src/org/acadgild/

# Solution Code Path for Task 2:
Assignment-3.3/Task 2/UnitsByStatesForOnida/src/org/acadgild/

I have attached the screenshots of program execution as well as the ouput file itself in respective task folders.
